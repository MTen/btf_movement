# rspec-rails: includes RSpec itself in a wrapper to add some extra Rails-specific features.
# factory_girl_rails: replaces Rails’ default fixtures for feeding test data to the test suite with much more preferable factories.
# faker: generates names, email addresses, and other placeholders for factories.
# capybara: makes it easy to programatically simulate your users’interaction swith your web application.
# database_cleaner: helps make sure each spec run in RSpec begin swith a clean slate,by–you guessed it–cleaning data from the test database.
# launchy: does one thing, but does it well: It opens your default web browser on demand to show you what your application is rendering. Very useful for debugging tests.
# selenium-webdriver: will let us test JavaScript-based browser interactions with Capybara.
